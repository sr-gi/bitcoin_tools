bitcoin_tools is a Python library created for teaching and researching purposes. It's main objective is twofold. First it 
aims to ease the understanding of Bitcoin transaction creation, by using well-documented and easy to understand
python code. Second, it aims to provide a tool able to create custom `transactions` / `scripts`. Either `scriptSig` and 
`scriptPubKey` can be built from human readable strings created using `Script` syntax. Finally, tools for accessing and 
analysing interesting data such as the `utxo set` are also provided, along with several examples.

bitcoin_tools allows you to:

* Bitcoin keys creation and management.
* Creation of Bitcoin transactions from scratch.
* Customize any field of your transaction.
* Transaction serialization / deserialization.
* Creation of standard and custom scripts (`scriptSig` and `scriptPubKey`).
* Transaction analysis from hex encoded transactions.

Additionally, bitcoin_tools contains ``STATUS`` an
**ST**atistical **A**nalysis **T**ool for **U**txo **S**et under [`analysis/status`](bitcoin_tools/analysis/status)

### Examples

Down below you can find some examples of how to use some of the library functions. More examples can be found in 
[`examples/`](examples/)

#### Key management and Bitcoin address generation
```python
from bitcoin_tools.core.keys import generate_keys, store_keys
from bitcoin_tools.wallet import generate_wif, generate_btc_addr

# First of all the ECDSA keys are generated.
sk, pk = generate_keys()
# Then, the Bitcoin address is derived from the public key created above.
btc_addr = generate_btc_addr(pk)
# Both the public and private key are stored in disk in pem format. The Bitcoin address is used as an identifier in the
# name of the folder that contains both keys.
store_keys(sk.to_pem(), pk.to_pem(), btc_addr)
# Finally, the private key is encoded as WIF and also stored in disk, ready to be imported in a wallet.
generate_wif(btc_addr, sk)
```

#### Raw transaction building  
```python
from bitcoin_tools.core.keys import load_keys
from bitcoin_tools.core.transaction import TX

# Key loading
btc_addr = "miWdbNn9zDLnKpcNuCLdfRiJx59c93bT8t"
sk, pk = load_keys(btc_addr)

# Reference to the previous transaction output that will be used to redeem and spend the funds, consisting on an id and
# an output index.
prev_tx_id = "7767a9eb2c8adda3ffce86c06689007a903b6f7e78dbc049ef0dbaf9eeebe075"
prev_out_index = 0

# Amount to be spent, in Satoshis, and the fee to be deduced (should be calculated).
value = 6163910
fee = 230 * 240

# Destination Bitcoin address where the value in bitcoins will be sent and locked until the owner redeems it.
destination_btc_addr = "miWdbNn9zDLnKpcNuCLdfRiJx59c93bT8t"

# First, we  build our transaction from io (input/output) using the previous transaction references, the value, and the
# destination.
tx = TX.build_from_io(prev_tx_id, prev_out_index, value - fee, destination_btc_addr)
# Finally, the transaction is signed using the private key associated with the Bitcoin address from each input.
# Input 0 will be signed, since we have only created one.
tx.sign(sk, 0)

# Once created we can display the serialized transaction. Transaction is now ready to be broadcast.
print "hex: " + tx.serialize()

# Finally, we can analyze each field of the transaction.
tx.display()
```
#### Raw tx analysis

```python
from bitcoin_tools.core.transaction import TX

# First a transaction object is created (through the deserialize constructor) by deserializing the hex transaction we
# have selected.
hex_tx = "01000000013ca58d2f6fac36602d831ee0cf2bc80031c7472e80a322b57f614c5ce9142b71000000006b483045022100f0331d85cb7f7ec1bedc41f50c695d654489458e88aec0076fbad5d8aeda1673022009e8ca2dda1d6a16bfd7133b0008720145dacccb35c0d5c9fc567e52f26ca5f7012103a164209a7c23227fcd6a71c51efc5b6eb25407f4faf06890f57908425255e42bffffffff0241a20000000000001976a914e44839239ab36f5bc67b2079de00ecf587233ebe88ac74630000000000001976a914dc7016484646168d99e49f907c86c271299441c088ac00000000"
tx = TX.deserialize(hex_tx)

# Then, the transaction can be displayed using the display method to analyze how it's been constructed.
tx.display()
``` 

#### Using STATUS to dump the UTXOs LevelDB
```python
from bitcoin_tools.analysis.status.data_dump import utxo_dump
from bitcoin_tools.analysis.status.utils import parse_ldb

# Set the version of the Bitcoin Core you are using (which defines the chainstate format)
# and the IO files.

f_utxos = "decoded_utxos.txt"
f_parsed_utxos = "parsed_utxos.txt"

# Set the coin we're working with
coin = 'bitcoin'

# Parse all the data in the chainstate.
parse_ldb(f_utxos)
# Parses transactions and utxos from the dumped data.
utxo_dump(f_utxos, f_parsed_utxos, coin)

# Data is stored in f_utxos and f_parsed_utxos files respectively
```

### Disclaimer

This library allow you to modify any transaction field as you pleased. However, some modifications can make your 
transactions non-standard, or even non-spendable. We totally discourage the  use of the library outside the testnet if 
you are not sure about what you are doing, specially when dealing with non-standard scripts. A bad use of the library 
can lead you to lose some of your bitcoins.
